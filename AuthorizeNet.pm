=head1 NOTE

Unlike Business::OnlinePayment or pre-3.0 verisons of
Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet, 3.1 requires separate first_name and
last_name fields.

Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet uses Authorize.Net's "Advanced
Integration Method (AIM) (formerly known as ADC direct response)" and
"Automatic Recurring Billing (ARB)", sending a username and transaction_key
or password with every transaction.  Therefore, Authorize.Net's
referrer "security" is not necessary.  In your Authorize.Net interface at
https://secure.authorize.net/ make sure the list of allowable referers is
blank.  Alternatively, set the B<referer> field in the transaction content.

To settle an authorization-only transaction (where you set action to
'Authorization Only'), submit the nine-digit transaction id code in
the field "order_number" with the action set to "Post Authorization".
You can get the transaction id from the authorization by calling the
order_number method on the object returned from the authorization.
You must also submit the amount field with a value less than or equal
to the amount specified in the original authorization.

For the subscription actions an authorization code is never returned by
the module.  Instead it returns the value of subscriptionId in order_number.
This is the value to use for changing or cancelling subscriptions.

Recently (February 2002), Authorize.Net has turned address
verification on by default for all merchants.  If you do not have
valid address information for your customer (such as in an IVR
application), you must disable address verification in the Merchant
Menu page at https://secure.authorize.net/ so that the transactions
aren't denied due to a lack of address information.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This module implements Authorize.Net's API using the Advanced Integration
Method (AIM) version 3.1, formerly known as ADC Direct Response and the 
Automatic Recurring Billing version 1.0 using the XML interface.  See
http://www.authorize.net/support/AIM_guide.pdf and http://www.authorize.net/support/ARB_guide.pdf for details.
